(2.0) Explanation of the code
-----------------------------

The game consists of 18 separate files and can be run from the main.py file. The main.py file opens the menu.py file that has options and some buttons using the Tkinter render library. The menu file also calls the generate.py script which generates the world from a few presets, or you can also use custom values for noise generated by our noise.py file or modifying the different thresholds for differing land types.

After the generate script has run you will be presented with the resulting map. You can safely close the preview window and load the save which will start the main game.py file which calls the renderer and the GUI scripts.
We also have the turn handler script which is currently only used to calculate money it has a function getMoney where it checks how much money you have you can either have True or False of money.

The movement script does mysterious things if you left click on a tile (tiles are not actually what are rendered those are other things also referred to as tiles) it selects the unit or city on said tile. If you have selected an unit and now right click on an adjacent tile the unit will be moved there.

The game also includes a revolutionary new saving system using the great file format csv the first 1250 lines are map data and the rest are info on your great empire. The save file editor is called Microsoft excel and can be found on most computers by default you can also use alternative applications for the purpose of save file editing.

The game is rendered using our own files Hexagonal_grid.py and renderer.py with the help of the Tkinter library the hexagonal grid file generates hexagons

(2.1) Explanation of the printouts
----------------------------------


As you may have noticed the game has multiple printouts during gameplay. There are 2 printouts for the initialisation of the game after that the next printout you will probably see is your map type Deset for desert pange for pangea or ocean cont for continents.

Due to our attempts to find some memory leaks you will probably next notice the amounts that the csv file has been read and every time you move you will also notice a memory dump from tracemalloc there are also a few prints related to 


----------------------------------
(2.2) Explanation of the Save file
----------------------------------


Our save file is best viewed with an application that colours the comma separated values differently like Mechatroner’s Rainbow CSV that allows you to see the different indexes more clearly.

The first value [0] is the X coordinate of the tile. The second index [1] is the Y coordinate of the tile. The third index [2] is the type of tile on the coordinates. The fourth index [3] is the type of unit on said tile. The fifth index [4] is the population of a city on the tile.

On row 1251 there are additional information at index 1 [0] is the current turn on index 2 [1] is current money and the third index [2] is your production per turn.
