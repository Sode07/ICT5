-----------------------------------------

The game consists of 18 separate files and can be run from the main.py file. The main.py file opens the menu.py file that has options and some buttons using the tkinter render library. The menu file also calls the generate.py script which generates the world from a few presets or you can also use custom values for noise generated by our noise.py file or modifying the different thresholds for differing land types.
